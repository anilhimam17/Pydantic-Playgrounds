"""
An agent run might represent an entire conversation â€” there's no limit to 
how many messages can be exchanged in a single run. 
However, a conversation might also be composed of multiple runs, especially 
if you need to maintain state between separate interactions or API calls.

To achieve a back and forth conversation with states preserved we utilise the 
result.new_messages() to the follow-up run() through the message_history parameter.
